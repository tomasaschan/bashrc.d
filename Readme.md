# .bashrc.d

This is a small directory of setup scripts I like to add to my profile on every system I'm on.

To use:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tomasaschan/bashrc.d .bashrc.d
$ ./bashrc.d/init.sh
```
Now, any files in `.bashrc.d` with file names ending in `rc` will be run as part of your profile initialization.
